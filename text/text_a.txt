The spirit of the WIE is for students to learn about working in a real-life environment. Ideally, the jobs should be related to the IW programme.  However, this is not a must.  

Previously, we have students who have gained sufficient hours in non-IT jobs such as sales or warehouse worker.  Note that it is the job environment, not the job itself, that matters.  E.g. Working as a self-employed private tutor is not suitable, but working as a tutor in a tutoring center is suitable.
